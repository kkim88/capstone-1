<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>

* This is a multistep problem that will require me to break it into individual segments and tackle them one by one
* There is a lot of things I do not know how to do and will need to look up information on how to do them

<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>

* Find examples of similar apps to draw inspiration from
* Design my idea of the finished product using pen and paper and wireframe apps
* Isolate the required features and functionalities I will need to look up information for
* Research each unknown component one by one
* Create each part of the app individually
* Combine them into a finished product

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>

* Upon doing some searches, I realized while it is called "inventory management," what I need to build is more of an online retail system and switched to finding examples of those instead
